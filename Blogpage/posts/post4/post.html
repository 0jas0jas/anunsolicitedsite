    <p>People are welcoming NFTs as the latest trend in the world of crypto, however we actually had this technology
      even before the invention of advanced encryption algorithms. Of course, now this technology can be used more
      effectively and securely, and it might carry the potential to change a lot about the internet you know today. If
      you don‚Äôt have any idea what these new so welcomed additions to the crypto world are, you should. </p>
    <br><img
      src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1620778187276-ea6c138e8b94?ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1500&q=80"
      alt=‚ÄùNFT‚Äù><br>
    <br>
    <h2>A Non-Fungible Token</h2><br>
    <br>
    <p>NFTs are actually quite simple. You‚Äôve seen people buying art pieces for millions of dollars, you‚Äôve seen people
      buy manuscripts of books for millions of dollars, and you‚Äôve seen so many other valuables being bought and sold
      everyday for a lot of money. Imagine all that and put it online. There you go. NFTs. </p>
    <br>
    <p> A Non-fungible Token is a token. A token which represents ownership like a paperwork saying ‚ÄúYou own this car‚Äù.
      Okay... owning is easy. We go buy so many things everyday from stores, why aren‚Äôt NFTs any different than amazon?
      That‚Äôs the non-fungible part. A fungible asset is what economists call an asset which can be exchanged without the
      loss of value. For example, money is a fungible asset and so is fresh bread. If I have a load of bread and I give
      it to you, you would probably exchange it comfortably with another loaf of bread. The same is true with money, a
      $100 bill is a $100 bill, we can exchange 2 similar notes and that won‚Äôt change the value of the note. And then
      there are non-fungible things, assets which do lose value when exchanged. You wouldn‚Äôt give me the one signed copy
      of a book which you had for almost all of your life for the same book, right? Even if I give you the same book, or
      even a signed copy of the same book; the value of the two items is different. They are non-fungible, assets which
      cannot be just exchanged. The painting Mona Lisa for a ‚Äúpainting‚Äù of the Mona Lisa? Nope. </p>
    <br>
    <p> And boy do we love collecting stuff. Who hadn‚Äôt the special pack of Pok√©mon cards as kids? Who wouldn‚Äôt want a
      signed album or a signed ball? Humans love the ownership of limited-edition stuff. There are people who bid on
      things for millions. It‚Äôs nothing new. NFTs are just a new look at this world we‚Äôve always had. Remember the
      digital painting you made? Or the song you recorded? Or literally the tweet you tweeted? That ALL can be sold
      through NFTs. What? How? The internet today is a mess. We all know that and NFTs won‚Äôt really clear up this mess
      (if anything, make it even more messy) but in between this mess, artists feel betrayed. A digital painting can be
      just shared by passing a JPEG/PNG. A recorded music single can be shared, just give me the MP3. A tweet can be‚Ä¶
      shared‚Ä¶ retweet it? I don‚Äôt know. Fun fact: The first tweet ever on twitter just sold as a NFT for $2.9 million.
      $2.9 million. Here‚Äôs the tweet. </p><br>
    <img src="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/first-tweet-810x476.jpg" alt=‚ÄùFirst Tweet‚Äù><br>
    <br>
    <p>So if I can show you this tweet, people can retweet it and people can share the JPEG or the MP3, then why NFTs?
      Why spend millions for something so publicly available? Well, yeah but haven‚Äôt you seen people on Instagram
      posting with fancy captions like ‚ÄúJust framed my <a
        href="https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2020/Jul/1595535659_24edittopgogh.jpg">Starry Night</a>‚Äù. If
      that person really has the Starry Night, they can share it just like that with anyone. However, their Starry Night
      is one or, as the economist would say, scarce. The painting is YOURS (if you‚Äôve bought it) and you can share it
      but it‚Äôll stay yours until you sell it. That‚Äôs exactly what a NFT would be like. Have it. Share it. The ownership
      is yours forever. You‚Äôll always get to brag about your 2.9-million-dollar tweet. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Definitively, NFTs are Non-Fungible Tokens which you can buy to prove your ownership for an asset which is proven
      to exist in a scarce amount. Seems too simple to exist‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs another side to it. The complicated side. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>The Complicated Side: Blockchains</h2><br>
    <br>
    <p>NFTs seem simple enough but how do they prove your ownership; how do they keep that ownership secure and how does
      all the crypto transactions work? The answer‚Äôs blockchains. Blockchains are networks of literal chains of literal
      blocks. Blocks are a pack of data used for storing crypto information. They are connected in chains to each other
      and they provide a really strong method of encryption to make sure no one can just alter your crypto transactions.
      Not only crypto transactions but also, they can help in keeping records, maintain a notary or hospital records.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> The first proper use of blockchains was in bitcoins. A block contains 3 things: the actual data, the hash of the
      block and the hash of the previous block in the chain (the first block in the chain has ‚Äò0000‚Äô as the hash for the
      previous block). The data can differ from blockchain to blockchain. In the bitcoin blockchain, the sender‚Äôs
      address, the receiver‚Äôs address and the amount of bitcoin are stored in the data section of the block. These are
      quite self-explanatory for a bitcoin transaction. The other 2 contents of a block are essential in keeping the
      block safe. A hash is a security string of characters which are uniquely different for all the blocks (IN THE
      WORLD). A hash is created by very complex mathematical operations. One of the algorithms for creating hashes is
      SHA-256. Each hash is like a fingerprint; unique. It identifies the block itself but it also identifies the
      sender, the receiver and the number of coins transferred. THIS basically means that if a hacker alters anything on
      the block, the hash changes. When the hacker even tries to do this, the chain breaks. As mentioned, the block also
      contains the hash of the previous block. So, Hacker changes contents > Hash changed > Previous Hash of the next
      block does not match up with the previous block > Chain breaks. So, if the chain breaks, wouldn‚Äôt it be disastrous
      for the whole blockchain? </p>
    <br>
    <p>Nope. Here comes P2P or peer-to-peer system. Every peer or user in the blockchain has a copy of the block chain.
      Everyone gets a copy! If everyone has an identical copy, they can check each other‚Äôs copies and verify them.
      Generally, for a transaction to be altered on a blockchain, you‚Äôll need to change more than 50% of ALL the
      blockchains for the transaction, for if more than 50% of the people agree that this blockchain is correct, then
      the block chain is correct! So, respected hacker sir/madam, you need to first change the block carrying the
      transaction you want to alter and then change all the blocks which follow and THEN do the same for more 50% blocks
      on the blockchain. Cool? Got it? </p>
    <br>
    <p>The way these blocks are created add another layer of security! Really, it‚Äôs that secure. However, I wouldn‚Äôt be
      covering it. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Okay this all looks quite perfect, innit? <h2><br>
        <br>
        <p> Ah NFTs. They can bring back the reward for making art nowadays, they can bring back so much. Here are some
          examples of how you or your company might use a NFT: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make 50,000 tokens as tickets for a baseball game. </li>
          <li>Make one single token for your artwork/music or any creation. </li>
          <li>Give your existing tokens as collateral to get crypto loans. </li>
          <li> Buy a skin for your favourite game and actually OWN the skin and sell it when you‚Äôre done with the game.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>And many more uses are coming up every day. Ethereum, a very popular blockchain, even claims that one day,
          you‚Äôll be unlocking your car using your NFT for the car. And therefore, people are calling NFTs the next big
          thing after the creation of the internet. HOWEVER, you right now all this requires massive amounts of
          computing power and energy. This high energy uses goes into keeping all this secure. And this is the energy
          that causes climate issues. Ethereum claims to reduce this consumption by a <a
            href="https://ethereum.org/en/nft/">99.98%</a> but that number is too huge to believe right now. With all
          the benefits to everything with NFTs, is it worth it? And as Lucius Fox from The Dark Knight would say ‚ÄúAt
          What Cost?‚Äù. </p>
