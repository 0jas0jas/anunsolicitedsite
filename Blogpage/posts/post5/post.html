    <h1>Automate The Boring Stuff With Python</h1>
    <p1 class="dateName">ðŸ“… 28/May/2021 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By Ojas Srivastava</p1>
    <br><br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>Python is powerful. The second most popular language (<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">according to TIOBE rating[27/may/2021]</a>) for a reason (the first most popular language is C for a
      reason too). Python is convenient for everyone; for beginners, for computer scientists or for mathematicians. All
      this because of pythonâ€™s easy usability and the widespread usage. Is python that good? Uh no. Python is a language
      made on the C programming language. It lets you program the way you want to program: procedural or
      object-oriented. However, it fails to successfully master a very important and necessary aspect of programming
      languages: speed. Python is easy to write, thatâ€™s why you can write python really fast but you are actually
      programming for the users, not for you, and python is not the fastest language. Fortunately, the creator of python
      announced that heâ€™ll be working with Microsoftâ€™s team to improve these issues in the language. Read more about all
      that <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/microsoft-is-boosting-its-support-for-the-python-programming-ecosystem/">here</a>.
    </p>

      alt="Python program wallpaper"><br><br>
    <p>What weâ€™re actually here for is a lot more. How many times have you woken up to press the same buttons to join an
      online meeting? Or how many times have you googled for something, going through millions of websites to find the
      one sentence you were looking for? Or have you everâ€¦ spammed? All these tedious everyday tasks are repetitive and
      boring. If only you had a bot to do all this for you. Fire up python and just automate these things! </p><br>
    <h2>AUTOMATION! </h2><br>
    <p> Here Iâ€™ll show you 4 programs. 4 templates actually. These are very VERY simple programs just to demonstrate how
      you can make your own scripts to write amazing programs to avoid these boring everyday tasks. Weâ€™ll be using new
      libraries and many new concepts to do these simple tasks. All the code for these four programs is <a
        href="https://github.com/0jas0jas/Automating-With-Python.git">here </a>, you can download the code and edit it
      as you like. </p> <br>
    <h2>Article Page Cleaner </h2><br>
    <br>
    <p>2 words. Web scrapping and BeautifulSoup. One is a revolutionary concept and the other is a library to
      implement that concept in your code. Web scrapping is looking at websites and finding the information you
      want. ONLY the information that you want from that website. Python makes this easy. Python has very useful web
      support libraries to help you achieve this. </p>
    <br>
    <p>This specific program is for those article readers who find usually find themselves in a mess full of futile
      advertisements and fancy graphics. It takes a site containing an article and converts it into a simple and
      convenient page with just the information without everything else. You can install the program by following
      the instructions in the github repository</p>
    <br>
    <p>BS4 or BeautifulSoup is an amazing library to make web scrapping a piece of cake. All you have to really do
      is get the page, store the HTML file in a variable and start looking for data you actually want from the HTML
      file. I have made a simple boilerplate HTML for a page that will convert this â€œscrapped" information into an
      easy-to-read article. Hereâ€™s how BS4 works. </p>
    <br><img src="article cleaner.jpg" alt="Article Page Cleaner"><br><br>
    <p>As youâ€™ve read, you need a variable to store the HTML file you are going to parse. However, before that you
      need to give python access to the web and let it visit the website itself. We use the python HTTP library
      (in-built) for this and to get (visit) the site, we need <code>'requests'</code> python library. In my program,
      Iâ€™ve also added an extra feature where you can just copy the URL of the website in your clipboard and it
      automatically gets the URL using another library called <code>pyperclip</code>. You can use this library to
      make you code run faster without redundant inputs from the user. To avoid taking ANY input at all, Iâ€™ve used
      the <code>sys</code> python library to see if the user has typed a URL after using <code>python3 cleaner.py
        [URL]</code> or not. This again avoids redundant inputs. Instructions in the README.md attached to the code.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>We stored our HTML file in the <code>noStarchSoup</code> variable as seen in line 19. Now all we have to do
      is get the information out. Any basic knowledge of HTML will make this task easier for you, there are a lot of
      ways to get data from a webpage. We wanted only the text of the article we wanted to read so I made a variable
      <code>elems</code> to store the elements in an HTML which contain the text of an article. These elements are
      the heading tags(h1-h6) and the paragraph tags(p). </p>
    <br><img src="Cleaner py.jpg" alt="cleaner.py code"><br><br>
    <p>I prepared a boilerplate HTML containing some simple CSS styles, huge font and readability. That done, you
      just have to get the <code>elems</code> variable INTO the HTML file. I opened the file using the built in OS
      library and justâ€¦ inserted it. Done. There you have your own article cleaner. Itâ€™s that easy. </p><br>
    <br>
    <p>Of course it shouldnâ€™t be this easy. This is just a template. Go ahead get whatever you want out of website,
      experiment and add it to a HTML file like I did or do something more creative. I donâ€™t know, youâ€™re the
      artist. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>A simple File Organizer</h2>
    <p>Oh donâ€™t you dare lie to me, weâ€™ve all been there with hundreds of files at hand. Messy directories are
      everywhere on my computer and also when youâ€™re creating something, there will obviously be useless extra
      files. These files have to be deleted, the useful files have to be kept in new directories and the files have
      to be sorted. All that can be done through python. Itâ€™s really simple. </p><br>
    <p>Although the code looks messy, it has a simple logic and making something like this for your need is easier
      than you might expect. Import <code>shutil</code> library to copy and move files and <code>pathlib</code>
      library which is just better than its predecessor, OS library, for managing paths and creating new
      directories. </p>
    <img src="organize py.jpg" alt="Simple file organizer"><br><br>
    <p> Most of the deleting, moving and copying of files can be done in single lines of code. Once you know those
      syntaxes, make your own logic to organize the files as you like. </p><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy: <code>shutil.copy(file_path, move_path)</code></li>
      <li>Delete: <code>os.unlink(file_path) </code></li>
      <li>Move: <code>shutil.copy(file_path, move_path)</code></li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>I mean why use the stupid GUI when you can code your program to delete stuff for you, am I right or am I
      right? </p><br>
    <h2> Gmail Email Sender </h2><br><br>
    <p>Now this is funny. The actual number of lines of code needed to send a gmail to someone isâ€¦ 2. Thatâ€™s all.
      All this thanks to Al Sweigart, a software developer and a writer. He made an amazing API allowing lazy people
      like us to automate gmails like that. You need to sign in to your google (gmail) account first. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Disclaimer: if youâ€™re planning to make your own program like this, youâ€™ll have to get a Gmail API for python
      authorization. Iâ€™ve used my own Gmail API so get yours! If youâ€™re just planning to play around with my
      program, I shall give you that permission. To register your python program for the Gmail API, just visit <a
        href=" https://developers.google.com/gmail/api"> Google Developers</a>. </p> <br>
    <p>To create your own Gmail app, install some google things using pip: <code>pip install --upgrade
        google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib</code>. Once this is done, go get
      your own API by searching for â€˜GMAILâ€™<a href=" https://console.cloud.google.com/home"> here</a>. </p> <BR><img
      src="Gmail API.jpg" alt="GMAIL API">
    <br><br>
    <p>Get your API and click manage API. Navigate yourself to the â€˜credentialsâ€™ tab and create a new
      credential. Create a new OAuth client ID and choose â€˜desktop appâ€™ in the application type dropdown.
      Name your app and create! You must see your ID now. Download the the credentials and rename it to
      â€˜credentials.jsonâ€™ and keep it in a directory.</p>
    <br>
    <p> That done, all you need now is to sign in to your Gmail account. Al Sweigart helps us here with his
      API, install it using: <code>pip3 install ezgmail</code>. Install it and create your new app in the
      same folder where you kept the credentials.json file. Name your python file anything but import
      ezgmail by <code>import ezgmail</code>. Sign in to your gmail account using
      <code>ezgmail.EMAIL_ADDRESS</code>, it must direct you to your sign in page. Youâ€™re all set up! </p>
    <br>
    <p>Check out <a href="https://pypi.org/project/EZGmail/">EZGmailâ€™s documentation</a> to find out what
      all you can do using this API and go send a mail. </p> <br>
    <h2>Mee6 XP miner<h2><br>
        <br>
        <p>Mee6, if you donâ€™t already know, is a discord bot which gives you XP for talking. Want to get
          to the top of the leaderboard? Use this bot. Leave it overnight and witness yourself climbing
          up the ladder. If you are not really looking for python scripts to cheat in a game, this
          program can still help you understand how you can use python to automate your keyboard. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Mee6 is no AI, it has an algorithm we can exploit. After spending 2 minutes on the websites,
          I found out that for every 60 seconds you talk, it gives you some random number of XP. It
          could detect that youâ€™re spamming so you just have to randomly say something once in every 60
          seconds. Easy. </p>
        <br>
        <img src="mee6.jpg">
        <p> We use the very useful pyautogui library for this task. It lets you use your keyboard to
          type and press keys. See where this is going? Rapid coding go! Step 1: get a random number of
          seconds between 20 to 60 seconds and store it in a variable ( this is the number of seconds
          weâ€™ll wait after each input ). Step 2: Look whatâ€™s inside the variable and wait for that many
          seconds. Step 3: Type a arbitrary word ( in my case, â€œhello") and press enter. Step 4: Repeat,
          keep all this in a loop so it repeats itself. Done. Itâ€™s that simple. Pyautogui makes it even
          easier. You can remove the waiting part to just straight up spam the chat or you can modify
          the code so it type something meaningful or do whatever your creativity allows you to do! </p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>What do we learn? </h2>
        <br><br>
        <p>So clearly you can automate a lot using just a few lines of code and as I said, these are just templates.
          This is the very surface of what you can do with automation and python. You can let your code use your mouse;
          you can actually make a program that will join online meetings for you automatically on time. You can try
          automating everything that you do on your computer. You could explore more APIs to do even crazier things.
          Apps and websites provide developers with their APIs to let us do amazing tasks. Try the Twitter API and the
          PRAW API for reddit. You can program a script that will check if a new video has come on YouTube and if it
          has, post an Instagram post. The possibilities are endless. Think of an automation idea and there WILL be a
          way to make it into a program. (The research for this article was majorly based on the book "Automate the boring stuff with python by Al Sweigart" I suggest you read for extremely detailed description of this topic.) </p>
