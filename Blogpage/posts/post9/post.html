    <p>Disclaimer: œÄ is irrational. Duh doy. We‚Äôve proved it over and over and over again, but this isn‚Äôt really about œÄ
      being rational or not. No no. This is about how mysterious the simplest of technologies tend to be even today when
      it feels like we‚Äôve mastered technology. But seriously, œÄ ISN‚ÄôT rational, don‚Äôt get any ideas. </p>

    <h2>The Confusion</h2><br>
    <p>Try this. Open up your calculator (a physical one) and type in 116 / 13 and look at the solution carefully.
      Chances are, (possibly if you‚Äôre using a CASIO scientific calculator) you‚Äôre getting a number in terms of œÄ. So,
      did we just prove that œÄ is rational? Case closed? Well, no. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Let‚Äôs bring Alice and Bob to help us grasp this. Alice wants to contact Bob and ask him out for coffee, but she‚Äôs
      afraid Hac Erman would intercept their messages and come to the caf√© too, which would just be horrendous for Alice
      and Bob (Hac is a HUGE pain in the butt). Alice and Bob decide to use the RSA encryption method to talk.
      Initially, Alice sends Bob a simple plain text message: ‚ÄúHey, I wanna talk.‚Äù. This intrigues Hac, naturally, but
      Alice doesn‚Äôt care. </p><br>
    <br><img src='116.png' alt=‚ÄùDiving 13 by 11^6‚Äù><br><br>
    <br>
    <p>We KNOW œÄ is not rational so why is this calculator which is supposed to be our guide in our mathematical
      endeavours beg to differ? We‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ know.</p><br>
    <h2>A deeper dive.</h2><br>
    <p>As one of my friends said after staring at this solution for an hour, ‚ÄúThis is nonsense‚Äù and it is. CASIO, what‚Äôs
      wrong with you? Is this the illuminati? Maybe. Maybe not. Modern calculators use approximations and weird
      complicated algorithms to give you the answers you deserve. Obviously, these calculators are made by us so we
      should be able to find the ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and fix it, right? We tried. This problem is not very young, too. It
      originated from a reddit post when a student was randomly punching in values in their calculator and came across
      this miracle. That‚Äôs unfortunate, as well, because now we don‚Äôt know WHY this division does so. We really don‚Äôt
      know what goes inside the calculator. We‚Äôve programmed it so that it can solve most problems easily but it‚Äôs
      problems like these that really highlight the flaw(s). We cannot change the programming because it works perfectly
      for everything. The only way out of this would be to understand WHY this happens. We don‚Äôt have an answer yet but
      here are some theories. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The simplest solution that comes to mind is that maybe this is a really close approximation of œÄ so the
      calculator feels best to just print out œÄ. No. The œÄ in this solution is accurate to the first 12 digits of œÄ,
      which is undoubtedly REALLY close but try this: 199 / 23. This answer is accurate to the first 15 digits of œÄ but
      the calculator just spits out the approximate value. Why? What‚Äôs up?</p><br>
    <br><img src='199.png'><br><br>
    <p>Okay, so it‚Äôs not the œÄ approximation trick. Then what? Maybe there‚Äôs something wrong with the numbers? The
      number 3600. If you take any gibberish number (not too big) and divide it by 3600, you‚Äôll get gibberish (duh).
      HOWEVER, if you take some gibberish number (not too big) and divide it by 3600 and then multiply it by œÄ, it gives
      you an answer in the multiple of œÄ. That might seem like an obvious thing but try dividing the same gibberish by
      some other number (other than 3600), you get gibberish. </p>
    <br>
    <p>What‚Äôs special about 3600? Perhaps, nothing. If you try a factor of 3600, like 240, it works in the same way. The
      lowest denominator seems to be 15, mysteriously. Note how everything is just a conspiracy theory now. Now what?
      There are only a few factors of 3600 what if we go for a bigger number? And sure enough 25200 also works (3600 is
      a factor of 25200). </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Just conspiracy theories?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Well yeah, we still have NO idea why this happens and if you do have any leads please reach out to me. It baffles
      me that something that we created can be this mysterious and that makes all this so much more interesting. Maybe
      it‚Äôs a CASIO thing. Maybe it‚Äôs a 3600 thing. Maybe something about the nature of pi? Maybe all of those. We have
      no idea and as scary as the ‚Äúwe have no idea‚Äù might sound, it‚Äôs quite thrilling. </p>
